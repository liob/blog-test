	abstract = {Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148–156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

	abstract = {Depiction of tiled imaging stacking. The green plane represents the base layer of the image in native resolution. The base layer consists of multiple image tiles. Stacked above the base layer are the intermediate resolution layers in grey. The length of the edge of the image (p) is cut in half on each intermediate resolution layer. This function concludes, if the current layer consists of only one image tile. This layer with the lowest resolution is also called the thumbnail image (blue).
The method of tiled imaging stacking is used to efficiently retrieve a region of interest with an arbitrary resolution, depicted by the virtual image in red, from a huge image file. This technique may be used in tiled tiff, jpeg200, dicom and other image data formats.},

But more than just a style manual, it offers guidance on how to navigate the dilemmas that authors, researchers and their institutions, medical editors and publishers, and members of the news media who cover scientific research confront on a daily basis. Written by an expert committee of {JAMA} and Archives editors, this 10th edition thoroughly covers ethical and legal issues, authorship, conflicts of interest, scientific misconduct, and intellectual property, in addition to preparation of articles for publication, style, terminology, measurement, and quantification. Customers who purchase the Special Online Bundle Package receive the hardcover 10th edition, as well as a one-year subscription to the Online Edition.},

	abstract = {Markdown is a lightweight markup language, originally created by John Gruber for writing content for the web. Other popular lightweight markup languages are Textile and Mediawiki. Whereas Mediawiki markup is of course popular thanks to the ubiquitous Wikipedia, Markdown seems to have gained momentum among scholars. Markdown really focuses on writing content, many of the features of today’s word processors are just a distraction (e.g. (fonts, line spacing or style sheets). Adding markup for document structure (e.g. title, authors or abstract) on the other hand is overly complicated with tools such as Microsft Word.},
