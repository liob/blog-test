	abstract = {The {AMA} Manual of Style is a must-have guide for those seeking to publish research findings and anyone involved in medical or scientific publishing. But more than just a style manual, it offers guidance on how to navigate the dilemmas that authors, researchers and their institutions, medical editors and publishers, and members of the news media who cover scientific research confront on a daily basis. Written by an expert committee of {JAMA} and Archives editors, this 10th edition thoroughly covers ethical and legal issues, authorship, conflicts of interest, scientific misconduct, and intellectual property, in addition to preparation of articles for publication, style, terminology, measurement, and quantification. Customers who purchase the Special Online Bundle Package receive the hardcover 10th edition, as well as a one-year subscription to the Online Edition.},

	abstract = {Markdown is a lightweight markup language, originally created by John Gruber for writing content for the web. Other popular lightweight markup languages are Textile and Mediawiki. Whereas Mediawiki markup is of course popular thanks to the ubiquitous Wikipedia, Markdown seems to have gained momentum among scholars. Markdown really focuses on writing content, many of the features of today’s word processors are just a distraction (e.g. (fonts, line spacing or style sheets). Adding markup for document structure (e.g. title, authors or abstract) on the other hand is overly complicated with tools such as Microsft Word.},
