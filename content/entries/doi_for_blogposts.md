Status: draft
figshare: true


I recently published my first figure (Tiled Image Stacking) [@winther_tiled_2014] on [figshare]. To my amazement I learned, that every item on figshare gets a [Digital Object Identifier][DOI] (DOI). This enables all items on figshare to be fully citable in publications. 

There are reservations in traditional journals to cite web ressources such as blog entries, wikipedia articles and websites in general. These reservations persist for good reasons. It even states in the wikipedia: "[We do not expect you to trust us]"

    It is in the nature of an ever-changing work like Wikipedia that,
    while some articles are of the highest quality of scholarship,
    others are admittedly complete rubbish.

Web sources may be edited after being cited, altering or removing relevant parts or vanish completly. Furthermore, most web ressources are not subject to any kind of peer review or even predominantly reflect the opinions of their author.
